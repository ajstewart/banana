"""
This is the Banana Django Project. At the moment the split between the Banana
app and the banana project is quite ambiguous since for now they are never used
separately. The Django Project is a placeholder for site specific logic or
media types, like custom settings, templates and logo's. The app should contain
all code that can be reused in an other Django project, together with other apps
with a specific independent purpose.

You can read more about this distinction in the `Django documentation resusable
apps section <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/reusable-apps/>`_.
