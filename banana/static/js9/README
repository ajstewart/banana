JS9 is changing how we think about image display and analysis, moving
beyond the Desktop into the Web. You can simply drag and drop a FITS
image from your computer onto the JS9 display. All of basic JS9/DS9
functionality is immediately available: zoom, pan, colormaps, scaling,
regions, WCS, etc.

For full installation instructions, start with help/install.html. But
really, just clone or download the JS9 source, display the js9.html page
in your browser, and drag and drop a FITS file onto the JS9 display.

You can extend JS9 using the Plugin facility in combination with the
JS9 Public API. For example, you can perform browser-based analysis on
the displayed image. On the JS9 Website, click the Plugins tab, create
a region, and move it around ...

In addition, URL-based data files support server-side analysis (using
the original data files on the back-end server).  Server-side analysis
can be run, for example, in response to region changes, with the
results displayed back in your browser. On the JS9 Website, click the
Analysis tab, choose a task, create a region, and move it around ...

We are very interested in exploring new uses for JS9 as we evolve its
functionality in response to community needs. If you would like to 
join the fun, please contact us at: saord@cfa.harvard.edu.
