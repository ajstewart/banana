Models
======

**banana.models** contains the Django ORM models. These Object Oriented
representation of a TRAP database. Since you don't initialise the TRAP database
using Django, we need to manually keep the Django models in sync with the TRAP
schema. Below we describe a procedure on how to do this.

Updating the model
------------------

You need to update the **banana/models.py** file to reflect the new database
structure. The easy way to do this is as follows:

  - Generate a new database with the schema version you want to upgrade to
    (using, eg, `tkp-manage.py initdb`). Either MonetDB or Postgres is fine.
  - Get a Banana installation which is able to connect to your database. You'll
    need to edit **project/settings/local.py** to set the appropriate
    hostname, port and password for MonetDB and/or for Postgres. Banana will
    build a list of all the databases on the host you specify, based on the
    assumption that the database name, username and password are all the same.
  - Within your banana directory, dump a set of models representing your new
    database by running::

        $ ./manage.py inspectdb --database=<dbname> > banana/models_new.py

  - Using your favourite tool, update **banana/models.py** to reflect the
    additions in **banana/models_new.py**. Note that **banana/models.py** has a
    bunch of useful customization which we don't want to lose. **don't** replace
    it with the new version, but rather carefully compare it with the new models
    and merge only the relevant changes.
  - Update the **schema_version** variable defined in **banana/models.py** to
    reflect the new schema.
  - Check for any templates (stored in **banana/templates**) which are using
    model fields which you've just removed or renamed, and modify them to use
    the new models.
  - Commit your changes, submit a pull request, and have a cup of tea.
